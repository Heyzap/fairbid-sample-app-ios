# FairBid - iOS Sample App

This sample acts as a demonstration for the FairBid SDK integration best practices. It is aligned with our documentation at developer.fyber.com which we recommend reading as well.

Please note that when it comes to actually demonstrating the product "FairBid" as a monetization platform this sample app might fail due to the fact that ad delivery depends on factors like your country, your device your AAID/IDFA or any other kind of information that ad networks might have collected about you and that are taken into consideration when placing a bid to show an ad to you.
